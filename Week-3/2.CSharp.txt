MethodOverriding:
=================
It is a concept of redefining or extending base class functions in derived class
the method should not be the static method
declared virtual keywork to the base class methods to override in child class
declared override keyword while redefined/extend the base class method in child class

Abstract Class
-------------
in c# abstract class is a class that can not be instantiated directly.It is meant to be inherited by other classes
it includes:
1. Abstract methods(no implementation)
2. Non-Abstract methods(with implementation)
3. Properties,fields,constuctors etc
When to use Abstract class
==========================
1. you want to provide common base for related classes
2. some methods must be overridden in derived classes
3. you want to provide default behavior for some members

Interfaces
============
an interface defines a contract that classes or structs can be implement.
interface is purely abstract
interface contain methods with no implementation
properties,indexes and events also include.

Why Interfaces?
==================
1. achieve the abstraction
2. enable multiple inheritance
3. to promote loose coupling(good for testing,dependency injection)
